      "businessChallenge": "Malawi's national elections relied heavily on traditional, paper-based processes, leading to critical challenges: complex logistics for distributing and managing paper ballots across remote regions, delays in counting and tabulating results, significant risk of human error and operational bottlenecks, limited transparency and difficulty providing real-time reporting, and many polling stations operating with unreliable or non-existent internet connection, making digital systems difficult to adopt. The country needed a secure, scalable, and connectivity-resilient digital voting system that could support millions of voters while still generating physical ballots as an auditable paper trail.",
      "solution": [
        "Offline-First Android Application (Kotlin): The core functionality—including voter processing, ballot generation, and data collection—works completely offline. When intermittent connectivity becomes available, the app syncs securely using a REST API with conflict resolution mechanisms",
