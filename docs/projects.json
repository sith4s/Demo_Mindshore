      "businessChallenge": "The organization ran a critical application ecosystem built on Strapi (Node.js), Angular, and PostgreSQL. However, they lacked a unified observability layer, resulting in: fragmented monitoring tools with no central visibility, limited insight into performance bottlenecks, insufficient log correlation across different system layers, slow incident diagnosis and difficulty identifying root causes, and gaps in security awareness—especially intrusion attempts and firewall activity. To ensure reliability and operational continuity, the client needed a centralized monitoring, logging, and alerting platform that spanned all components.",
